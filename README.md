# GitHub-Avatar-Generator
Simple tools generate avatars of GitHub style.

I use `opencv-python` to generate these pictures, and `opencv-python` can be easily installed to your Python environment by `pip install opencv-python`.

After downloading this repository, you can modify generating parameters in the top of `square.py` and `circle.py`. By the way, a higher image resolution is recommended, for one, the image generated looks more better, for another, there exists some noisy dots in circles image.

I will appreciate it if you want to talk about your interesting ideas on avatar making. A PR is welcomed and thanks for your contribution!
